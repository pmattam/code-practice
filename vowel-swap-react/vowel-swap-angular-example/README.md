# AngularJS Vowel Swap

You will use the vowelSwap function you wrote in part 1 in order to build
the web-based AngularJS version of Vowel Swap. You are given a template to
work with, which includes these files:

* index.html
* angular.js
* app.js
* style.css

To run the application, open the index.html in your web browser.
You will need to modify these files (some, but not necessarily all of them) in
order to produces an application in which the user can:

1. Enter any desired text into a text area.
2. Click the submit button to perform vowel swap on the text within the text
area.

## Demo

A demo application has been given to you as a reference in vowel-swap-demo.html.
Your AngularJS-based application will need to be able to do the same thing as
the demo.
