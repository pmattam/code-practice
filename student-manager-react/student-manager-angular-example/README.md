# Student Manager Application

## Template

A template has been provided for you which includes these files:

* angular.js
* app.js
* index.html
* style.css

To run the application, open the index.html in your web browser. You will
need to modify these files (some, but not necessarily all of them) to
build a student manager application that allows an instructor to do
the following:

1. View the list of students in his class. The list will display the first
and last name of each student, as well as their favorite smoothie flavor.
2. Add a new student - the instructor will be able to click an "Add Student"
button, and then enter the new student's first name, last name, and favorite
smoothie flavor.
3. Remove student - the instructor will be able to remove a student by
clicking on a "x" button next to that student in the student list.

## Demo

A demo application has been provided for you as a reference of how the app
should work. You'll need to provide an AngularJS-based application that
provides the same functionality. You do not have to use the exact same design
in every aspect, but it should satisfy the same requirements.

## Bonus Challenge

* Make it persist using browser storage such as the local storage API
